This project is focused on information systems analysis and design. It includes four parts (Assignment 3, 4, 5, and 6) and is based off of a fictious application called the BestPurchase application.

Part 1 (Assignment 3)
Focuses on defining the scope and mission statement, as well as the creation of user stories and use cases. Functional and non-functional requirements are determined, and the State Transition, Sub-States, and Graphical User Interface designs are created.

Part 2 (Assignment 4)
Focuses on designing with the Unified Modeling Language (UML). A use case is selected and revised. A Sequence and Class Model diagram are created. Three business classes are selected, as well as one non-business class. These classes are described in relation to the design and their relationship to other classes.

Part 3 (Assignment 5)
Focuses on the design goals and data flows. The Class Model diagram is revised to include packages. The packages are described with their name, design goals, and design tradeoffs. The Logical Data Flow and Physical Data Flow diagrams are created and described.

Part 4 (Assignment 6)
Focuses on specifying design details. An updated Class Model diagram is presented. A method from the Class Model diagram is selected and an Activity diagram pertaining to this method is displayed. A Focused Sequence diagram is created based on an activity from the Activity diagram. Lastly, pseudocode is created for the selected method.
